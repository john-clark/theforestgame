I had problems running on Server 2019 core so I had to use Windows 10

1. run install-steam.bat

2. run install-theforest.bat 

3. run openfirewallports-theforest.bat

4. Edit server config

    Change serverIP

    Change serverPasswordAdmin

    I had lots of hackers, because clients can run cheats. I set serverPassword and was able to play with friends undesturbed.

5. move server.cfg to 

    C:\Users\%username%\AppData\LocalLow\SKS\TheForestDedicatedServer\ds

6. run start-theforest.bat
